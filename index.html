                This is Sander and his friend Chad. They were at the "fadderuke", and from there they got to know each other. 
                On this day, they played football and Sander scored, whilst Chad played the pass to Sander. They also played volleyball where Sander won MVP
                MVP is an acronym for most valuable player and basically means Sander was the best on the field that day.

                On this picture you can see Pete Johansen with his friends when they travelled to Seoul in South Korea in summer. As you can see Pete travelled with three of his friends from LÃ¸renskog also known as L-wood
                After that they went to watch an Arsenal game where the score ended 2-2 and they drew to Crystal Palace. Where his childhood hero Pierre Emerick Aubameyang scored. On that day Alexandre Lacazette and Odsonne Eduard also scored.

               On this picture you can see Sander again. He took his driving license last summer where he had driving lessons at Baerum Traffic School.
               This is really important for him, because he is really interested in cars. So taking the license meant the world to him and he passed.

               On this picture you can see Soban. He travelled to Cyprus and when he came back he got covid-19 and had to isolate 14 days at a quarantine hotel in Tonsberg.
               At this picture he was taking the plane from Poland and was extremely jet lag. According to him the airport were not taking covid-19 serious enough, and this might result in him getting covid.

            In this picture you can see Sander on the bus. This is according to many sources Pete`s favourite picture of Sander. Considering Sander lives in Oslo he has to travel by bus often.
            This basically means that the public commuting has to work for Sander to get to school.

               Here you can see Soban first arriving in Cyprus. The temperature was extremely warm there and eventually rose to 40 celsius. According to him he had to be careful with covid-19, because in Europe Cyprus had the highest infection rate.
               Him being careful eventually did not matter, because after all he ended up catching the virus.
