    <p> First off we had to make the wireframe/sketch. It was a lot of different programs we could of have chosen, but we felt like figaro was really weird to use, so we ended up using balsamiq, because some of the group was familiar to the program
    After that we started designing the website. We knew we had to display 6 different pictures related to the summer. So from that information we decided on displaying the pictures in a 2x3 grid with a turqouise-ish background.
     One thing we were really careful about was that the mobile sketch made sense. We knew we had to have 1 picture at one time, or else the website would look extremely messy.
     We used the picture element to sort the different images easier and making the code much easier to read
     We also used media query to make the mobile version of the website. This was kind of tough in the start because the grid would constantly be out of line, so we basically had to try out different things until the code made sense and the website looked clean and smooth.
     The 6 pictures we used were supposed to give the website a more happy and humorous vibe to it. 
     After adding the pictures we decided on adding some text to each picture. This was to make the website look a bit more professional.
     Also you can see that by using css we also played around with the :hover attribute and if you click on anything on the page something will change.
     I think making sure that everything was the right size as the wireframe was probably the hardest part, because we were supposed to make a website out of something we drew, and making sure the images were in the right size and width was also kind of hard.
     We had to use classes to make the grid, and we used the attribute section to pair up with the picture p and img attributes respectively</p>
